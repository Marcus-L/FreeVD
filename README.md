__What is the difference between pin app and pin window?__  
An easy way to imagine this is if you use `pin window` on a chrome browser window, 
only that window will be visible on all desktops. Any other chrome windows would 
stay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then 
all chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.
