Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Hotkeys and System Tray Icon

__Installation__  
This program uses `IsolatedStorage` for the settings file so in order for each new version to read the same settings file it is important that the program be unzipped and run from the same location everytime.

It's preferable to run directly from the `Startup` folder

You can get to the `Startup` folder by typing `Startup` into the address bar of any Windows Explorer window. Simply copy the file into that folder.

__Features:__

__Hotkeys:__

These are the default hotkeys. You can configure these any way you'd like.

__Navigate Desktops:__  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> - this is Windows Default

Move Windows:  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

Move Window & Follow:  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad</kbd>  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd>RIGHT</kbd>

Pin/Unpin Applications:  
<kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>

__What is the difference between pin app and pin window?__  
An easy way to imagine this is if you use `pin window` on a chrome browser window, 
only that window will be visible on all desktops. Any other chrome windows would 
stay on a single desktop. If you were to `pin application` on a chrome window then 
all chrome windows would show up on all desktops. This includes new chrome windows.
